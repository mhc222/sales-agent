## ICP Basics

### What is an ICP?

ICP stands for "Ideal Customer Profile". An ICP is a detailed description of the type of customer/business that would benefit the most from your product.

### Why do we need to have an ICP?

Knowing your target audience allows you to tailor your outreach to increase conversion, select appropriate prospecting channels, and resonate with your potential customers.

### Key criteria for identifying your ICP

There are a few data points for you to focus on to build your ICP:

**Demographics:** age, location, industry, company size, job title, etc.

**Firmographics:** Company revenue, industry, number of employees, etc.

**Pain points:** What are the common ones that your product addresses?

**Buying Behaviour:** Look for patterns in their decision-making, purchase frequency, and what influences it.

**Fit for your solution:** Determine how well prospects align with you and look for indicators of a strong fit.

**Customer lifetime value (CLV):** Consider the long-term value prospects can bring, and identify those with higher potential for repeat purchases.

---

## Persona Basics

### What is a persona?

A persona is very similar to an ICP except it is just the person.

So you can have a persona within an ICP, it is mainly a job title for example a CFO / Finance manager as the persona.

### Why do we need to have a persona?

**Different people/roles care about different things.**

Therefore your offer can relate to an HR director & also a CFO.

**However, the pains an HR director faces day to day are very different from a CFO.**

Therefore if you know your persona you can create relevant messaging that actually resonates with the prospect.

**HR** - Cares about the people, cares about employee engagement

**CFO** - Money, bottom lines, profit
- Pains: high rates on FX
- Pains: high rates on card costs

**COO** - operations, efficiency etc
- Pains: takes 2 weeks to get new cards to employees
- Pains: takes day to complete a bank transfer

## How to Nail Down Your ICP

Now you may have a super broad ICP, so how can you get specific?

Here is an exact process to nail down your ICP & Persona.

### Step 1: Account Discovery

Begin by analyzing your current customers, inbound leads, and some notes.

What are the common points across the accounts?

Then Document key data points such as:
- Company size
- Location
- Industry
- Sub-industry
- Tech stack
- Inbound lead characteristics

Then analyze sales funnel data to understand which companies have the highest close rates, highest deal values, and reasons for lost deals.

Then use this analysis to define your Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) criteria.

Including titles, company size, team size, technographics, and triggering events.

**Example:**
- Title: CFO, Head of Finance
- Company size: 25-100
- Location: UK, EMEA
- Industry: SAAS
- Sub-industry: Ed-tech
- Triggers: Recently hired to the role, Recent Series A funding round

Remember, regularly review this as your ICP will evolve with time, check this every month to see which industries are working the best.

### Step 2: Find the Right Persona

Identify the job titles of personas within your Dream ICP criteria that are involved in the buying process.

Make sure to note at what stage they were brought in though.

For example, it could be the Finance Manager first, then the Director of Finance is tied in for the second call, then on the last step the CEO is on for the final decision.

In this case, it would make sense to prospect the Finance Managers, not the CEO straight away as they only get involved in the backend of the deal cycle.

Now you know the titles its essential to understand the roles, processes, challenges, and motivations of these personas.

We sell based on problems, not features.

Use the **buyer persona matrix** to give you a base of this for your situation.

The matrix is powered by AI and a great base, however, it's not perfect.

So use it to give you a starting point then build on it and add in more specific examples.

You can find this from the deals you have closed, talking to the sales teams about the most common problems prospects come out with and which solutions are often used to solve it.

### Step 3: Who's the Competition?

The likelihood is your prospects will already have solutions in place.

The solution is just their current process - this is what you're competing with.

This doesn't always have to be a piece of software, they could be doing it manually, etc.

Therefore you need to identify both direct competitors and alternative solutions that your prospects may be using.

By doing this you can find the gaps in their current process with whatever they're using and explain how your offer fills that.

Make sure to note down the main competitors and the issues with them.

You never need to bad-mouth them, but noting down their problems can help you in creating relevant messaging.

### Step 4: Your Dream ICP

After you have done all of these steps compile your learnings and you'll have your ideal customer profile.

Again, make sure to regularly review this as you may see specific industries using your product more and more.

## Buyer Persona Matrix

The main benefit is to understand what they care about, what they spend their time doing, their pains, and the implications it has on their business.

Use this AI prompt to give you a matrix template.

**Top tip:** The more information you give ChatGPT, the better it performs.

So for an outcome of an AI email product, don't just say:

*"We help companies book more meetings"*

Explain it in depth, like:

*"We help companies to create highly relevant personalized emails by reviewing the prospects LinkedIn, this, in turn, helps with increasing positive replies and booking more meetings"*

### Prompt 1

Go onto this website: {insert your companies website} and tell me the 5 main outcomes they provide for their customers in detail.

What departments within companies should I target for my sales outreach?

### Prompt 2

Based on that what departments within companies should I target for my sales outreach?

### Prompt 3

For each of those departments, please summarize below points. Return the data in tabular format, with the below points as column headers. Each department will have its own row. Here are the points to summarize:

- What individuals in each department care about as it relates to business outcome
- KPIs, which are the specific KPIs for the job role, the department and day to day. Do deep research to ensure these KPIs are accurate.
- How individuals in each department spend their time to achieve business outcomes, what they do in the day to day.
- 3 common issues individuals in each department often struggle with to achieve those business outcomes
- The impact / Cost of inaction this has on the person / KPIs / company specifically
- How the solution I sell may be able to help individuals in each department hit their KPI goals and avoid the issues & impact

## Prospecting Basics

### What is Prospecting?

Prospecting is the process of identifying and reaching out to potential customers.

It involves researching and qualifying leads to determine if they are a fit.

### Why is Prospecting Important?

Prospecting is what fills the top of the funnel.

You need to build a pipeline so you can have a strong flow of leads which then turns into opportunities and sales.

Now why should you care about getting good at it?

If we don't prospect we simply won't have enough people to reach out to and ultimately hit our targets.

As an SDR / BDR prospecting will be part of your everyday life.

But... Prospecting is tough.

Most of the people we reach out to are not looking for a new solution and do not care.

So if you learn to master this skill, you'll be more likely to reach out to people who are either actively looking for new options or more willing to learn.

Instead of spending hours getting rejected constantly, you can build targeted lists and send messages that convert.

### How can we make it easier?

As we said most people are not interested in hearing about new solutions.

So it can be tough to break through to new people.

But there are ways we can make it better.

That is using intent signals to find people who may be more willing to learn about new options.

## Easy Wins - Prioritization

This is the easiest way to book easy meetings.

Doing this was one of the main contributors to the fact I hit 150% consistently.

This is one of the first things I teach any new SDRs I work with.

### What are the easy wins?

General rule of thumb: 80% of your revenue will come from 20% of your accounts.

While many other sellers will complain about their territory and wish they had more accounts, get laser-focused on your best accounts.

So it's not about getting more accounts, it's about making the best use of the accounts that you have been given.

### How do we find the easy wins?

To determine your best accounts, weigh these 2 factors when doing your research.

**ICP = Ideal Customer Profile**

Description of the perfect company or customer you want to target for your business.

This is unique to each org but use the ICP you have built from module 2 here.

You may not be able to tell if a company exactly fits this ICP, so just make your best guess.

**CTC = Chance to Convert**

As an SDR you're likely being targeted on the quantity of meetings booked & not the size of the accounts.

For example, if you are an SMB (small and medium business) SDR, then all of your accounts will fall under this size.

For you to make a commission you just have to book meetings with these potential clients.

So the main thing you should be focusing on is how likely is this business to turn from leads to SQL (sales qualified leads) / meetings.

Now how do you tell if a company has a high chance to convert?

Imagine there are two companies.

One has heard of you before and even downloaded a free resource from your website a while back.

The other has never even heard of your company before.

Which one do you think is going to be more receptive to outreach?

The first of course.

### Intent Signals for High CTC

**If they downloaded a resource / requested a demo in the past**

This should go without saying, but this is a gold mine.

Section your accounts and look for the ones who have done actions like this before.

You can leverage this in your outreach as a trigger.

**Closed Lost**

This can be a great place to find accounts and re-engage in a conversation.

Maybe it just wasn't a good time for you to talk to them, so circle back to them now.

### Account Prioritization Framework

**Perfect fit:**
- Perfect ICP + Easy CTC
- 1-2% of your total accounts

**Priority 1:**
- Strong ICP and strong CTC
- 5% of your total accounts

**Priority 2:**
- Great ICP and okay CTC OR okay ICP and great CTC
- 15% of your total accounts

**Priority 3:**
- Either poor ICP and/or poor CTC
- 80% of your total accounts

Now this can take a while.

So sit down and put in the time upfront to break your accounts down.

Once you have done this you will know which accounts make the most sense for you to target.

The perfect fit & P1's get the most personalized touches.

Whilst P3 accounts you can rely on more automation.

If you don't have a specific way on your CRM, just add a text field which says PF/P1/P2/P3.

Alternatively, you can do it more manually on Google Sheets along the way.

## Intent Signal Basics

### What are intent signals?

Intent signals are indicators that a prospect is showing interest or readiness to engage in the buying process.

These signals can be identified through a number of ways.

This can be things like visiting your website, downloading resources or engaging with your content.

### Why should we use intent signals?

If you focus on the accounts that are showing some sort of intent then you can better prioritize your outreach and time.

Let's make an example, you have two accounts.

Same persona & same industry

One of the accounts has never heard of your business before.

The other has downloaded all of your company resources and also been engaging with all your content.

Which one would you rather reach out to?

The second right?

Yeah of course.

You can utilize the action they have taken in your outreach and use this as a "trigger".

Data from Hubspot suggests that personalization in your outreach can increase reply rate by 142%.

So by using these intent signals you'll be able to have a better idea on if it is a good time to reach out & also have a reason to message them.

---

## Identifying 22 Intent Signals

Here is a huge list of intent signals for you to check out.

### 1. Job Changes

When someone starts a new role they've been brought in to have a positive impact, this will likely include changes in their process.

So it can be a great time to introduce how your solution has helped others overcome relevant issues.

**Example:**
> Hey name
> 
> Saw you joined company name as title a few months ago,

### 2. Key Contacts Leave the Account

When a key persona leaves the account this can be a sign that bigger things are changing.

Therefore you may be able to engage with the remaining team to see if their goals have shifted.

**Example:**
> Hey name
> 
> Saw name recently left as the VP of sales, curious how you plan to onboard & ramp your new SDRs?

### 3. Not Happy with Their Current Solution

If your prospect is publicly saying that are not happy with a specific provider, USE THIS.

Keep on top of things like news articles or interviews to see if there's potential issues.

**Example:**
> Hey name
> 
> Saw your recent comments about x solution,

### 4. Employee Growth

See if the company headcount is growing, LinkedIn SalesNav can be a great tool for this.

As they grow it may make sense for them to look into different solutions to match their new size.

**Example:**
> Hey name
> 
> Noticed on your LinkedIn the sales team has grown by 15% in the last 5 months, curious how

### 5. Downloaded a Resource / Requested a Demo Before

If a company has ever downloaded a free resource from your company or even requested a demo, even if it was months ago - this is gold.

They are showing your CLEAR intent that they are looking into a solution for their pain.

So use this in your messaging.

**Example:**
> Hey Sam
> 
> Saw you downloaded my email templates, imagine you're looking to get a process to help your new SDRs ramp.

### 6. Technology Usage

Looking into a companies tech stack can give you clear insights on their current processes.

You can see if they are not using a specific tool for a task and the issues they may bring.

You can use this information to identify potential opportunities for offering complementary products or services to their existing tech stack.

**Example:**
> Hey name
> 
> Looks like you're using Folk for your CRM, curious how

### 7. Event Announcements

If your prospect is organizing an event like a conference, they will likely be going for a clear reason.

They will likely be going to discover new products, services, and industry trends.

Therefore someone going could be likely open to change, and you can leverage this in your messaging.

**Example:**
> Hey name
> 
> Saw you're attending x conference name,

### 8. Profile Views / Likes / Comments

This is mainly for LinkedIn but its when a prospect engages with your profile in one way or another.

This shows they are engaging with your account & are somewhat familiar with you so you can leverage this.

**Example:**
> Hey John
> 
> Saw your comment on my post saying "video outreach is the future", curious if you're currently using any videos in your teams outreach?

### 9. Fundraising

When a company raises funding they will have a bigger budget & expectations to manage.

As they are scaling they will likely be open to solutions to meet the new targets that have been set.

**Example:**
> Hey name
> 
> Saw your recent Series B funding round (huge congrats!), Curious how you plan to scale & grow the SDR function at company name

### 10. Open Job Roles

When a company is hiring you can see which areas are important based of the open roles, it's also a positive sign in general.

As they are bringing on more staff they will likely run into issues.

So you can use the growth or potential challenges and leverage open job roles in your outreach.

**Bad Example:**
> Hey name
> Saw you have open roles at company name ❌

**Good Example:**
> Hey name
> Saw you have 2 SDRs openings in the EMEA region, ✅

### 11. Layoffs

If there has been a level of layoffs then it's likely they are struggling in at least one area.

Therefore you can introduce a solution to help them to reduce further layoffs and get back on track.

**Example:**
> Hey name
> 
> Saw the recent restructure over at company name,

### 12. LinkedIn Content

This shows they are trying to grow and drive engagement.

It presents an opportunity to monitor the content shared by the company or the individual so you can have relevant messaging.

### 13. Major Customer Acquisition

When your potential client secures a major account they will likely have more eyes on them.

Therefore you can leverage this to how you can help them utilize this etc.

**Example:**
> Hey name
> 
> Saw the recent acquisition of company name

### 14. Internal Movement

Look for changes in the company, people going into new management roles or team lead etc.

Your prospects will likely be willing to listen to new ideas if they have been recently put into new roles.

### 15. Company Followers

If a prospect is following your company then they are likely familiar with your solution and how you help.

Therefore when you reach out it is likely that they will have heard of your name before.

### 16. Acquisitions

M&A and partnerships offer opportunities to talk about relevant solutions.

As two companies join they will likely have new issues as they become combined.

### 17. Previous Customer

If you have booked a meeting / closed a deal with a prospect then they move companies in the same industry this can be great.

As you already helped them solve an issue before you can see if this is still relevant for their new role.

**Example:**
> Hey name
> 
> We worked together when you were back at company name to solve x issue, curious how you're managing that now over at y company?

### 18. New Offices / Expanding

Look for when companies have either added new locations or just expanded.

This can be used in your outreach as they will likely have new requirements as they move or grow.

### 19. Updated Website

You can check their website to see if their priorities have changed.

This shows they are trying to improve their online image and so you can use this when reaching out.

### 20. Online Presence

When potential customers are actively seeking solutions like yours, they engage online, leaving behind a digital trail.

By keeping on top of this you can see if they are actively looking for solutions and also which solutions they are looking at.

Giving you a relevant angle in your outreach.

### 21. Press Coverage

This is when the company or a person is being highlighted in the press.

You can use whatever was mentioned as the trigger in your outreach.

---

## Leveraging Intent Signals in Outreach

### What should I do?

Now you have a structure of intent signals, how do you actually use this?

**You always want to put your most relevant information first. ALWAYS HAVE THE WHY!!!**

By doing this you are cutting the fluff and helping to provide immediate context and relevancy to your messaging.

So you should always lead with your trigger.

In 2024 the bar is so low with general messaging.

If you focus on breaking your messaging into different intent signals, you'll be able to send relevant messages at scale.

### Doing it manually

In a lot of the templates in the following modules, you will see a "trigger"

The trigger is where you add the reason for reaching out (the intent signal).

You can easily do this manually, it will take time but it's worth it.

There are two ways you can do this:

### Generalized Intent Signals

This is where you use an intent signal that can apply to multiple people at once.

The benefit of this is you can group multiple accounts into these buckets to reach out to, making it more efficient.

However, it will be less specific than finding an exact piece of information.

For example, this could be:
- Companies hiring for a specific role
- Companies who have just raised funding
- People just got hired
- Company growth

Again the benefit of this is you will be able to group multiple accounts & still be relevant, but it is not a personal email.

However, this can still work great.

- Use this for P2
- Use this for P3 - slightly more generalized if needed

### Specific Info Intent Signals

This is where you do some research manually to find a super specific piece of information about the company / prospect.

The benefit of this is it can be highly relevant but it takes a lot longer to do so is much harder to do at scale.

For example, this could be:
- Finding a podcast where the prospect mentions a specific issue
- Reading the prospects newsletter to find a piece of information

This is great but only if you have the time to do so.

Use this for perfect fits & P1

Categories:
- Personal - but info that relates to the company / offer
- Business - that relates to the offer
- Personal - not related to the offer

### Doing Both: Leveraging Clay

This is possible by leveraging [Clay](https://clay.com).

In Clay you can use Claygent or ChatGPT to find a specific piece of information for each account.

Therefore each email is completely different to the next, but you can get thousands of these instead of one at a time.

## Sales Navigator Prospecting

### Why Sales Nav can work?

SalesNav is something most of you will have.

It can be used as a great resource to leverage intent signals.

### The key thing to remember

Make it specific.

Everything we went through in the ICP & persona section put the details in here.

Use the industry, the geography, the specific job titles etc.

The images are only examples, but when you do this for yourself, add in the extra details.

---

## Sales Navigator: Persona & Saved Searches

### Personas

A persona is a pre-saved set of criteria. This can be the geography, industry & title so you don't have to upload it every single time.

![Sales Navigator header showing search bar with Lead filters, Account filters, Saved searches, and Personas options](IMAGE: Sales Navigator Navigation Bar - Shows the top navigation with search functionality and filter options)

![Sales Navigator Personas panel showing how to create a new persona with job title filters like Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director](IMAGE: Creating a Persona in Sales Navigator - Demonstrates the persona creation interface with job title, function, seniority level, and geography filters)

### Saved Searches

Saved searches is an easy way to keep track of the list criteria that you set out, this is so you don't have to manually add it each time & you can keep track of updates.

![Sales Navigator Saved Searches panel showing multiple saved searches with new result counts](IMAGE: Saved Searches in Sales Navigator - Shows a list of saved searches including SDR/BDR searches, Finance ICP searches, and various industry-specific searches with their new result counts)

**Top Tip** - set weekly reminders on each of the saved searches that you make. This way you'll always have a new set of leads to go after.

## Sales Navigator Play: Job Changes

### Play Overview

This play targets new hires in your ICP.

When someone is hired into a key position, they are brought in to make a positive change to the organization.

For this reason, they're far more likely to be open to evaluating new software & services if it aligns with their initiatives.

### How-to

1. Apply your "Persona"
2. Under "Spotlights", add the filter "Changed jobs in the last 90 days"

![Sales Navigator showing Changed Jobs filter applied with search results showing recently hired executives](IMAGE: Job Changes Filter in Sales Navigator - Shows the Changed jobs toggle enabled under Recent updates, with search results displaying CEOs and executives who were recently hired)

---

## Sales Navigator Play: Tracking Your Champions

### Play Overview

Anytime you have a positive conversation, book a meeting or close a deal with a prospect, save them to your "Champions" list.

Check the list once a month.

If one of those leads goes to a new company, you can reach out to see if they'd be open to exploring your product for their new company.

### How-to

1. Create a new lead list called "Champions"
2. Anytime you have a positive conversation, find the lead on Sales Navigator, then hit "Save" and select your "Tracking Champions" list
3. Once a month, open your list, then select "Changed jobs in the past 90 days" to see who you can reach out to

![Sales Navigator Create lead list dialog showing creation of a "Tracking Champions" list](IMAGE: Creating a Champions List - Shows the dialog for creating a new lead list named "Tracking Champions" with description field)

---

## Sales Navigator Play: Customer Alumni

### Play Overview

This play targets prospects who used to work for a customer of yours.

They either (a) used your product directly in their previous role so they will already be familiar

Or (b) they didn't use your product, but the social proof of their previous company will make them more receptive to your outreach.

### How-to

1. Apply your "Persona"
2. Under the "Company" filter, select "Past company"
3. Add any number of current customers to that list

![Sales Navigator showing Past company filter with Gong selected, displaying results of people who previously worked there](IMAGE: Customer Alumni Filter - Shows the Past company filter set to "Gong" with search results showing former Gong employees now at other companies)

---

## Sales Navigator Play: Your Executive Team's Network

### Play Overview

This play targets people who are connected to your company's Executive team.

Depending on their level of popularity, they likely have a large list of connections ranging from previous business relationships to fans of their accomplishments or content.

These connections are far more likely to know your company and/or have respect for your Executive team, meaning they'll be more receptive to your outreach.

### How-to

1. Apply your "Persona"
2. Under "Connections of" select someone from your Executive team

![Sales Navigator showing Connections of filter with James Wright selected, displaying executives connected to that person](IMAGE: Executive Network Filter - Shows the "Connections of" filter with an executive's name selected, displaying CEOs and founders in their network)

---

## Sales Navigator Play: Headcount Growth

### Play Overview

If a company has a large increase in headcount, there is a much higher probability that they are experiencing growing pains that require new software.

Especially if that growth is happening in the department you sell to (i.e. the sales department).

### How-to

1. Apply your "Persona"
2. Under "Department headcount growth" select the department you sell to, then move the toggle to 25% or more (meaning that the department has grown by at least 25% in the last 6 months)

![Sales Navigator Account Search showing Department headcount growth filter set to Sales 25%-200% growth, with results showing large companies](IMAGE: Headcount Growth Filter - Shows the Account Search with Department headcount growth filter configured for sales growth, displaying companies like Chevron, Boeing, and Shell with buyer intent indicators)

---

## Sales Navigator Play: Company Followers

### Play Overview

This play targets prospects who follow your company on LinkedIn. Filtering out current customers, they are obviously familiar with your company so the conversations will be much warmer.

### How-to

1. Apply your "Persona"
2. Select "Leads that follow your company on LinkedIn"

![Sales Navigator showing Following your company filter enabled with results showing leads who follow the company](IMAGE: Company Followers Filter - Shows the "Following your company" toggle enabled with search results displaying executives who follow the company on LinkedIn)

---

## Sales Navigator Play: Previous Worked at Your Company or a Competitor

### Play Overview

Prospecting people who used to work for your company (as long as they left on good terms!) is one of the easiest ways to get referrals. (a) they're already familiar with your product so they'll know if there's a need and who to point you to. (b) any outreach coming from a previous employer is going to stand out amongst the sea of other emails they receive. Similarly, prospects who've worked for a competitor of yours will know the space well and likely be familiar with your product.

### How-to

1. Apply your "Persona"
2. Under the "Company" filter, select "Past company"
3. Insert your company name or your competitors names

![Sales Navigator showing Past company filter with Revolut selected, displaying results of people who previously worked there](IMAGE: Former Employee/Competitor Filter - Shows the Past company filter for finding people who previously worked at your company or competitors)

---

## Sales Navigator Play: Customer Referrals

### Play Overview

Sales Navigator lets you see people in your ICP who are 1st degree connections of your customers so you can reach out to those customers and ask for introductions.

### How-to

1. Pull a CRM report of people who have bought your product (preferably people who you booked the initial meeting with/closed)
2. Send them a connection request. A simple note like, "Hey {{name}}, saw you were a customer of ours and wanted to connect!" should work.
3. Once you're connected, enter their name under the "Connections of" filter, and apply your "Sales preferences"
4. You should now have a list of ideal prospects in that customer's network. Find 2 or 3 prospects that you would like intros to and use the following template to make your ask.

---

## LinkedIn DM Basics

### What Is A LinkedIn DM?

It's just a message that you send to a prospect.

LinkedIn is a great place for us to find & engage with our ICP, but to DM them we need to be connected.

### So What's Important to Remember?

**Where so many people go wrong, is they will pitch slap the SECOND a prospect accepts, or they ask for 30 minutes of time before adding any value.**

**DO NOT** sell straight away.

The goal of this is to start a conversation, we want to see what they are struggling with & if we can be a fit to help them.

Either ask an open-ended question or immediately give value.

**The whole goal of this is to just get a response.**

Before we even think about booking meetings we need a response.

Then once they respond, again **DO NOT PITCH YET!**

**Before you even mention anything about your product, you need to find their pain points.**

**So start asking questions:**
- What does their current process look like?
- How long have they been doing it like that?
- Typically that means x can be an issue, have you found that?

You need to identify a pain before pitching.

Once you have found an issue they have, show them the negative outcome of not fixing it.

If they don't change what will that lead to?

Only once you have done this should you introduce your product.

Focus on their problems, not your features.

### Best Practices

**Keep it Concise:** Short and to-the-point messages tend to perform better on LinkedIn. Nobody wants to read a block of text, keep it to a few sentences.

**Personalization is Key:** Do not send a generic or AI-generated message. Use a relevant piece of info to make it clear why you are reaching out.

**Highlight Value:** Clearly communicate the value proposition or benefit of engaging with you or your offering. Focus on how your product or service can solve a specific pain point.

**Follow-Up:** If you don't receive a response to your initial message, don't be discouraged. Follow up as sometimes it can take a few touches to get a response.

**Track and Analyze Performance:** Keep track of all your metrics like open rates, response rates, positive replies and meetings booked. By checking your metrics you will see which areas need the most work in your outreach.

---

## LinkedIn Process: Engaging with Leads

Here is a step by step process of how to find leads & how to engage with them using a value based approach!

### Step 1: The Connection

Use SalesNav to send out connection requests to your ICP (no note)

No note works great to get them to accept.

You can also add a note here with a value based CTA, but this play is designed to have that come later.

### Step 2: Familiar Face

Comment on their posts after they accept (SalesNav)

**Engage with their content, make yourself a familiar face.**

Add value in the comments though, don't just put "Great post"

Comment about a specific point of the post, ask their opinion about a topic they discuss, get them to engage with you.

If it is a post on the 5 major changes in the SDR role, then pick one of the points & ask about how they think it will change in the future etc.

### Step 3: The Message

Two ways you can do this:

**Basic Message**

In this you would use one of the initial message frameworks.

Again the goal is to start the conversation. Have it open ended.

**Lead Magnets**

Message them with a value based CTA, give them value they can use.

You giving them a case study is not value, look at the lead magnet examples for inspiration.

But what if they don't respond to the messages?

Use one of the follow up templates.

Don't spam your prospects just send a few relevant touches.

### Step 4: Questions

**Basic Message**

Once they have responded, ask questions to understand their process.

Use the SPIN ideas we talked about in the last section.

**Lead Magnets**

If they say yes to value, narrow down what they'd like help with.

Get specific, this is where you can identify a pain they are facing.

For Example:
> "Great, any threats specifically you'd like me to focus on? We're seeing [pain 1] [pain 2] [pain 3] pretty often."

> "Any use case in particular you'd like to see? I can send one on [pain 1] [pain 2] [pain 3]"

This helps understand their challenges/priorities.

### Step 5: Set the Next Steps

**Basic Message**

Now you go into how your solution helps.

Again you have to make sure they have a relevant pain, then tailor how your solution can help.

Then you would have a soft CTA looking to get them booked into the next steps, like "Think this could be worth discussing in more depth together on a call?"

**Lead Magnet**

When they answer, send them over what they asked for and create the next steps.

For Example:
> "Here's a use case that covers X. I'll reach back out next week to get your thoughts on it. Let me know if you have any questions"

Remember to add a task to touch base with this person in a few days to ask their thoughts.

You can also "star" the conversation on LinkedIn so you remember.

## LinkedIn Initial Message Frameworks

### What's the purpose of these?

These messages are designed to follow the principles that we had spoken about previously.

The whole point of these is to start a conversation, not pitch slam.

### Why is that important?

You are a stranger, nobody cares about what you have to offer until they see how it can help them overcome their issues.

But to find their issues we need to talk to them.

That's why it is so important to start a conversation first before talking about our solution.

Start the conversation -> Find their current situation -> Find the problem with that -> Show how your product solves it

---

### Framework 1: The Relevant Message

**Structure:**
- Trigger
- Compliment
- Permission for questions

**Example Structure:**

Hey {{first name}} - {{trigger}}. {{Compliment something}} {{Ask permission to ask questions}}.

**Example Message:**

> Hey John - listened to your interview with Sam. Love the process you're using for ramping your SDRs. Mind if I ask a few questions about it?

**Why this works:** You are showing you have done your research & you make it clear why you're reaching out. Also the permission before asking questions makes the ask not as hard.

---

### Framework 2: The Relevant Message 2

**Structure:**
- Trigger
- Permission for questions
- P.S

**Example Structure:**

Hey {{first name}} - {{trigger}}.

{{Ask permission to ask questions}}.

{{Personalized P.S.}}

**Example Message:**

> Hey Oliver - saw on Glencourt's LinkedIn that you have offices in the UK, USA & Europe.
> 
> Mind if I ask a few questions about how you're managing the currency exposure?
> 
> P.S. A sub 4h marathon is amazing! I died trying to run a 4k yesterday haha

**Why this works:** This is the same as the previous message, but a P.S just helps to add another layer of personalization.

---

### Framework 3: The Relevant Message 3

**Structure:**
- Trigger
- Curious how?
- Permission for questions
- P.S

**Example Message:**

> Hey John - saw on Apple's LinkedIn that you have offices in the UK & Asia.
> 
> Curious how you're managing the daily currency exposure.
> 
> Mind if I ask a few questions about it?
> 
> P.S. saw you've been promoted 5x there - congrats on the success

**Why this works:** Very similar to the message above, but the "curious how?" is a way to get into what you think may be a priority. Again it is a concise message that is geared towards just starting a conversation.

---

### Framework 4: The Question

**Structure:**
- Trigger
- Pain
- Permission

**Example Message:**

> Hi Mark - congrats on the launch!
> 
> Most international start-ups pay an excess of 5% on cross-border fees
> 
> Would you mind if I sent you some information on how we've been helping Apple reduce this to 2%?

**Why this works:** You again start with the trigger showing why you are reaching out. Then by jumping into the pain its typically what can be an issue, then you are suggesting how you can help it. The only reason this isn't my go-to is its quite heavy on knowing their pains instead of learning them.

---

### Framework 5: The Video Ask

**Structure:**
- Trigger
- A solution to the issue

**Example Message:**

> Hey Will, I connected because I noticed you're bringing on new reps.
> 
> If it's relevant, open to me sending a video of how we can help scale email coaching to those sellers within your SalesLoft setup?

**Why this works:** For this if you know they typically have a pain directly correlated to the trigger it can work great. Then you are just asking permission to send it over to them.

---

### Framework 6: The Pain & Question

**Structure:**
- Pain
- Ask a question

**Example Message:**

> John - typically when I speak with VP of sales they say getting their reps to send relevant messages at scale is a challenge.
> 
> Have you seen something like this?

---

## LinkedIn Lead Magnet Frameworks

### What's the purpose of these?

The whole idea is to give them a piece of valuable information so they want to respond.

### Why is that important?

As we spoke about in the past section, starting the conversation is the most important thing.

That's why lead magnets can be amazing.

You just offer them something that can actually help them in their day-to-day.

That's it.

No ask for a meeting or a call we just give.

If you give, and it is something actually valuable, people will trust you and want to engage in a conversation.

### So what actually is a lead magnet?

One thing to know is what actually is a lead magnet.

A lead magnet is not a case study or a testimonial, it is a piece of information that they can immediately use.

For example:

If you are an outbound lead gen agency and you offer email campaigns.

Your lead magnet could be 5 email templates that got the most replies.

This way even if your prospect doesn't buy from you they have still received immense value.

The more value the better.

### This is a key point!

Don't ask for anything in return.

If they respond saying yes, this is your time to narrow down:

> "Will do - any specific area you want me to send info on?"

Chances are, their answer is the pain they have.

From here you can keep asking questions about this pain to understand the true issue.

Now is your time to shine.

Give them value what they can use straight away.

> "Here's how people are increasing their reply rates by 9%. [USE CASE COMPANY] was able to do that in 90 days. Let me know your thoughts".

Then follow up in a few days to see how they got on with it, don't rush them through it.

---

### Lead Magnet Framework 1

**Structure:**
- Call out an issue
- Offer a free value-based solution

**Example Message:**

> Hey Sam
> 
> 25% of sales leaders say their emails don't get enough replies.
> 
> Mind if I share an email template that gets up 20+ meetings per week?
> 
> Aaron

**Why this works:** You called out a relevant problem. You are offering value without an ask. There is no "can I have 30 minutes" you are just offering them pure value.

---

### Lead Magnet Framework 2

**Structure:**
- Offer a free value based solution
- Call out an issue

**Example Message:**

> Hey Adam
> 
> Mind if I share an email template that gets up 20+ meetings per week?
> 
> 25% of sales leaders say their emails don't get enough replies.

**Why this works:** Same reasoning as above.

---

### Lead Magnet Framework 3

**Structure:**
- Give something that you know solves their pain
- Hope it was helpful

**Example Message:**

> Here's a list of 50 accounts that have shown interest in your company: [link]
> 
> Hope it was helpful

**Why this works:** You have given them immense value without an ask. When they see the value they will be keen to learn more.

---

### Lead Magnet Framework 4

**Structure:**
- Trigger
- Problem
- Social proof & solution

**Example Message:**

> John, saw that Reach's latest blog post doesn't include a Meta tag which can affect its online visibility.
> 
> Apple improved theirs by creating meta tags using ChatGPT.
> 
> Can I share how?

**Why this works:** Trigger for why it is relevant, a problem to show why they should care to fix it right now. Social proof to increase credibility. Solution of how they did it, offering value by sharing how, soft CTA.

---

### Lead Magnet Framework 5

**Structure:**
- Lead magnet
- Social proof achieving result
- We have value

**Example Message:**

> Hey Troy, would you mind if I send over new strategies sellers are using to increase their pipeline? We have tons of data on what's helping sellers generate more opps.

**Why this works:** Offering immense value straight away, you're showing how others are using it to succeed. You finish by further solidifying why they should want it because of your credibility by having data etc.

---

### Lead Magnet Framework 6

**Structure:**
- Trigger
- Curious how / implication
- Pain
- Lead magnet

**Example Message:**

> Hey Troy, saw you brought on 3 new SDR's last Q
> 
> Curious how you plan on getting them ramped under 3 months?
> 
> Most companies take 6 months to get reps fully ramped and hitting target
> 
> Mind if I share the process Gong used to get reps hitting full quota in 2 months?

**Why this works:** Offering immense value straight away, you're showing how others are using it to succeed. You finish by further solidifying why they should want it because of your credibility by having data etc.

---

## LinkedIn Follow Up Message Frameworks

### What's the purpose of these?

Your prospects are busy, they may not see your initial DMs.

By following up you will give yourself the best chance of getting their attention and a response.

---

### Thoughtful Bump ✅

**Structure:**
- Given x is a focus
- Thought this could be useful

**Example:**

> Given you're looking to improve the teams outbound replies, thought this would be useful.
> 
> Any thoughts on my last message?

**OR**

> Given you're looking to improve the teams outbound replies, thought this would be useful.
> 
> Or am I completely off the mark?

**Why it works:** With this framework, you're doing two things:
- You're tapping into your reader's sense of urgency. No one wants to miss an important message.
- You're verifying that your message deserves urgency because you reference that context for why you reached out in this note and the original note you customized.

---

### One Liners

**Structure:**
- Just have one line to keep it brief

**Examples:**
- Bad timing?
- Wrong person?
- No budget?
- Already got this covered?

**Why it works:** It is super brief and just remind them of why you were reaching out.

---

### Labeling

**Structure:**
- Label why they haven't responded

**Examples:**
- It seems like my timing is off.
- Looks like I'm off with my assumption.
- It seems like the value isn't there for you.
- It feels like you're happy with what you have.

**Why this works:** People love to tell you when you're wrong, so they will often come back and tell you a clear reason for why they haven't responded & you can then dig into the pain.

---

### The Gif

**Structure:**
- Just send gif :)

**Example:**
> Me waiting for your reply
> [GIF]

**Why it works:** Now play to your ICP, some will hate this some will love it but that's sales! It's different - prospects receive the same generic messages 24/7 and stand out in their inbox.

---

### The Whiteboard

**Structure:**
- Just send a selfie of a whiteboard with their name & logo on it
- Any thoughts on my last message?

**Why it works:** This shows that this image is only for them and nobody else. It shows you have spent the time to be different - again their inboxes are crowded with the same stuff, be different.

---

## SPIN Questioning for LinkedIn

### So you actually got a reply, now what?!

**We have to nail down a pain.**

**Pains are everything in messaging.**

Once we know what pain / issue the prospect has, we can show them the **negative outcome** of not fixing it and how our solution helped others fix it.

**We are NOT going to send 100 questions over and treat the DMs like a discovery call.**

But you do need to find the issue.

**DO NOT PITCH SLAP - IT'S LIKE A BITCH SLAP**

### SPIN Questioning

SPIN stands for Situation, Pain, Implication, Need payoff.

This is typically used in discovery calls but you can use one question from each section to really nail down a prospects pain.

### BAB Framework

Before After Bridge.

We need to show where the prospect is right now, if they don't change and why its bad.

Then the after to how they can get to a desired outcome.

Then we bridge how they get there with our solution.

---

### Situation

Find their current way of doing things.

**Questions:**
- "What's your current process look like for x?"
- "How are you currently managing x?"

**Example:**
> How are you managing the onboarding for James & Sarah?

**Prospect:**
> I am doing it all myself currently!

---

### Pain

Identify their pains with their current solutions.

**Questions:**
- "Typically {{title}} struggle with x, have you come across that?"
- "Typically x can be an issue, how are you managing that?"

**Example:**
> Typically head of sales struggle to spend 1-1 time coaching their new reps with how busy their own calendar is, have you come across that?

**Prospect:**
> Yeah it has been tough with us also restructuring at the moment.

---

### Implication

Show them what will happen if they don't fix it.

**Questions:**
- "What impact is that having on x?"
- "How is that affecting x?"

**Example:**
> How is that affecting how quickly they've been able to ramp?

**Prospect:**
> Yeah they have taken a bit longer than we had hoped

---

### Need Pay Off

Explain the value and benefits of solving their solution.

**Questions:**
- "What would happen if you could {{achieve desired outcome}}?"
- "If you had {{solution you offer}} what would that mean?"

**Example:**
> What would happen to their ramp time if you could get reliable 1-1 coaching from industry experts?

**Prospect:**
> Yeah, I think it would be beneficial for sure

---

### Close

Now tie in how you helped someone get to that desired outcome with your solution.

**Example:**
> Makes sense, most leaders have the same issues!
> 
> We actually just helped Gong ramp their new hires in 2 months through our coaching program.
> 
> Think this could be worth a further chat?

**Prospect:**
> Yeah for sure does Tuesday work for you!

---

### Main Thing

Again don't bombard them with 100 questions, just find their pain.

They do not care about your product.

They care how your product can solve their problems.

So focus on finding their issues before jumping into a pitch.

---

## LinkedIn Content 101

### Profile Optimization

**The Basics**

Your profile is your landing page, if it looks attractive people will be more likely to accept and actually engage in a conversation with you.

### 1: Your Profile Picture

- Smile - don't look neutral or aggressive to approach
- Natural lighting is great for this to make it look authentic
- When you send a connection this is one of the first things they'll see so it is so important to have this nailed down from the start

### 2: Your Banner

**Company based**

Now if you are at a company they will have a ton of neutral backgrounds you can use and these are okay and make it seem natural.

They are normally quite generic and just have the company colors, a slogan and the logo.

These are fine if you are focusing on making your LinkedIn linked to the company.

**Personal Based / Side Hustle Based**

You have to remember your LinkedIn is YOUR brand.

It can act as a mini resume, a mini CV or just in general a landing page for people to check you out.

So if you don't want to just post about your company topics then this style can be great.

**Talk about the destination not the plane ride**

People don't care as much about the exact process to get there, they care about what the other side looks like.

If you were trying to convince your friend or a partner to go on holiday to Hawaii, you wouldn't talk about the hours on the plane ride and the specific seats you're going to get, and the distance you're going to travel.

You'd talk about the end destination and sitting on the beach in the sun.

Your banner should be the same.

The main focal point is the end goal, then you briefly explain how to get there.

### 3: Your Headline

Again people don't care if you are an SDR @ X Company

Remember the points we just raised, show them how they can achieve a specific desired outcome.

**Framework:**

I help {icp} {achieve desired outcome} through {solution}

**Examples:**
- I help Sales leaders hit 150% of quota with outbound systems
- I help IT teams reduce data errors by 10% with our platform

Show people what you can help them achieve.

### 4: Your Featured Section

Now this is the last key part to get down and have done well.

Your featured section is essential, don't just have some random posts pinned.

Push people to a specific page, for me it's my communities.

For you it could be a company resource behind an email so they have to give up their email to access.

This is great so then you can reach out to these people and have your own mini inbound lead funnel.

---

## LinkedIn Content: Winning Hooks

### The Basics

This is the one thing that will get people to actually check out the rest of the post.

If your hook doesn't grab attention people will keep scrolling.

The whole point of a great hook is something that makes someone stop in their tracks.

### So What's Important to Remember?

LinkedIn breaks posts down by "see more"

This means the first lines will be shown and to see the rest people have to click see more.

So you only get a few lines to make a true impact!

Your hook should be specific, drive curiosity and get them wanting to read more.

### Use Stories - How I ...

Talk about what you specifically achieved.

Always make sure it is a specific desired outcome too for example:

- "How I {achieved result} and you can too"
- "How I {achieved result} in {time frame}, copy my exact process"

The point is to show how you have done something your ICP wants to achieve.

Now if you are working in a role where you haven't done it yourself, just switch it to "How to"

### Use Metrics

Using specific numbers makes it seem real, and further shows the great outcome you achieved.

If I said "Here's how I booked more meetings in Q3" versus "Here's how I booked 24 more meetings in Q3" it's clear to see which one is more impactful.

So always try to use specific metrics in your hooks.

### You Can Too

People love to be told they can achieve whatever amazing result you talked about.

So if you talked about how you achieved a great result and you are educating them on how they can too.

Talk about it! Let them know.

A few ways to do it are by saying:
- "You can copy my process"
- "Steal my framework"
- "How you can too"

## LinkedIn Content Structure

### The Basics

Thinking of content is often the hardest thing for anyone who's just getting started.

You can spend hours thinking of a single idea.

But when we have a structure & system for creating content it becomes a lot easier.

### So What's Important to Remember?

Each post should only take you 10-15 minutes.

Content should be simple and low friction.

There are different stages to the content funnel: top, middle and bottom.

Each stage of the funnel is key.

---

### TOFU - Top of the Funnel

**For massive reach, easy content**

The easiest way to think about this content is what will get you in front of the most people.

This can be giving away resources for free and offering immense value. It could be:
- Carousels
- Infographics
- Lead magnets (personal favorite)

I recommend lead magnets for these posts 100%

---

### MOFU - Middle of the Funnel

**For education**

The main goal is to build authority & trust with the audience, stories to get them invested into you and why they should listen.

Content in this:
- How I posts
- Strategy breakdowns
- Personal stories

You want to position yourself as an expert in the niche.

---

### BOFU - Bottom of the Funnel

**Driving people to take action**

Very similar to MOFU, but at the end you have a clear CTA, to download, to DM you etc.

The top of the funnel gets people in, the middle nurtures these people, now the bottom is there to convert them.

Content in this:
- Case studies
- Social proof

Focus on having normal content then tying in a brief CTA at the bottom of the post.

It should only be one line, not the whole post trying to sell.

---

## Cold Email Foundations

### What is A Cold Email?

A cold email is just an email sent to a prospect who has not heard of your product or service.

### So what's important to remember?

The goal of a cold email is not to blast your entire list of target customers or be spammy (i.e., be a nuisance).

Treat your email like an invitation to a conversation.

A good cold email has a clear reason for being sent.

After, show the link it into the potential issues they could be facing with that etc.

An excellent cold email isn't trying to close the deal or pitch your product.

Just like you wouldn't ask for marriage on a first date, don't aggressively pitch your product right away.

---

## Email Best Practices

These stats are also backed by the data provided by [Lavender](https://www.lavender.ai/product), they have tested millions of emails to gather this.

So trust numbers over feelings!

### Simplicity

70% of emails are written at or beyond a 10th-grade reading level.

The data shows writing at a 3rd to 5th-grade level can increase your replies by 50%.

Use short simple words and choppy sentences. Avoid commas or other complex grammar.

Don't make the mistake of using big words to sound smart.

Credibility comes from understanding the buyer's situation and problems.

It doesn't stem from jargon.

So make it as simple as possible.

### Formality

You might want to use formal words when speaking to a stranger.

But you don't have to do this by email. In fact, you shouldn't.

Pretend you're writing to a friend you haven't met yet.

Another way to think about it is to write how you'd speak (just remember to edit those run-on sentences after).

Again this can change for different personas.

So use this as a base and feel free to change it up to see what works best!

### The shorter, the better

The average person takes about 9 seconds to scan your email.

They won't read it word-for-word.

So use this to your advantage.

Keep it under 75 words but aim for about 25-50 words to get your point across.

Using fewer words can increase your chance of response by 68%.

Think about your readers' experience when they open and read your email.

Your goal is to make it as easy as possible for them to read and reply.

### The Ask

Be super clear.

You're seeking to start a conversation, not asking for their time or requesting to book a meeting.

There should be one clear ask.

An interest-based CTA can work amazing for this.

Keep it open-ended to increase the likelihood of them responding.

For example "Open to seeing how?"

### Embrace white space

Break up your email into multiple one-line sentences or short paragraphs (1-2 sentences).

It's easier to read and it's essential to creating a mobile-optimized email that gets replies.

Fun fact: A single line in Outlook or Gmail on the desktop becomes two to four lines on a phone view.

Those add up quickly and make your email look a lot longer than it is.

So use white spaces to your advantage.

### Toss the clichés

"I hope this finds you well." "Do you have 15 minutes?" "I'm sure you're busy."

These are a few examples of commonly used and abused clichés. Cut 'em all.

They are overused and buyers immediately filter cliché messages as spam.

They are immediate turn-offs and waste valuable space.

---

## Email Tonality

### Watch your tone

Even a CEO is human.

So treat them and talk to them like one.

Be friendly and casual — while also being professional and **clear**.

A good test is to read your message out loud.

Would you be embarrassed to say it to a friend or family member?

If so, you might want to re-write it.

### So what tones work?

Lavender has done the work and it shows that "unsure" tones can work great.

But what do we mean by "unsure?"

Most think "unsure" (aka tentative) tones are a bad thing for sellers.

In sales, you're taught to be confident.

You're taught to avoid creating doubt.

Turns out... uncertainty works in cold emails.

**What makes for an unsure tone?**

- Ask questions
- Use language that implies questions. ex: "Let me know if you'd like more information."
- Use hedge words
- Use passive language and conditionals

### Why Unsure Tones Work

Let's put ourselves in the buyer's shoes.

Your buyer is sitting at their computer, they see an email come into their inbox and think, let me open this one.

They're greeted by:

*"Hi Will,*

*You got hired as VP of sales. Ramp time must be..."* 🤮

You already know this message is a "sales" email.

It runs right up against your mental spam filter. It's what you might picture when you picture a "sales-y" email.

Your buyer wants to be understood, but they also want to be heard.

They live in these problems daily.

When you show up and just talk at a prospect about their problems, they don't absorb it like you think they would.

Even if you're right, they're inclined to say, "who are you to tell me anything."

It's like a teacher telling a student what to think.

That is not THE vibe we want to give across.

### So how can we avoid this?

❌ Talk to the prospect about their role

❌ Don't try to educate them (they deal with it everyday)

❌ Say they HAVE to have an issue

All of these are examples of talking at the buyer, making them switch off.

You have to keep them engaged, and tonality is key.

Unsure tones keep readers from tuning out.

Even if you "know" something, buyers are more receptive when you write as if you could be wrong.

### How to use it with a trigger

The trigger acts as why you are reaching out, then you have to tie this into relevancy, why does that mean it makes sense for them to talk to you.

This means you're looking to see if they have a problem.

There is a right & a wrong way to do this.

**❌ Educational Approach:**
> I saw you're hiring. According to {blog}, X% of new sales hires don't hit quota.

**❌ Neutral Approach:**
> I saw you're hiring. You must be starting to think about ramp.

**✅ Unsure Approach example:**
> Looks like you're hiring. Typically, this means sales leaders are starting to think about ramp.

In this unsure example, hedge words create uncertainty.

A word like "typically" might seem like fluff, but it sets the stage for an "unassuming assumption."

It also positions yourself as knowing the industry and your buyers situations.

**✅ Unsure Approach example:**
> I saw you might be hiring. I could be wrong, but are you starting to think about ramp?

In this example, a hedge word (might) helps create uncertainty around the trigger.

Then they're invited to correct the writer as the narrative moves into an assumption around their problems (I could be wrong).

The phrases "looks like" and "are starting to" are also softened phrases.

If you apply these tones to the frameworks we will go through you will see a huge difference.

---

## The F-Shaped Reading Pattern

### What is the F-shaped reading pattern?

People typically don't scan left to right & the F-shaped reading pattern is one of the most common eye-scanning patterns that readers use for content blocks.

This was identified as the most used pattern during an eye tracking study by The Nielsen Norman Group & the results were a result of over 200,000 participants.

### Why is it even important?

People's attention spans are lower than ever before. The likelihood that people will read through your entire email is so low.

People will scan through & if nothing interests them they'll leave.

So if you know how people will likely look you can place your CTA in the right place.

& ultimately convert more leads.

### So how does this help with emails?

When we are making our emails we have to be conscious of how the reader will likely view it.

So here are a few tips for using this in your emails:
- Place the most important parts in the hotspots of the pattern
- Make the email super concise & readable
- Design it for scanning, don't use large blocks of text

This is a subtle factor but it can help a ton.

---

## Email Subject Lines

### The Basics

It's a phrase that provides a preview of the email content.

An email subject line is the first thing your prospect will see.

This is your initial impression to the prospect.

It's crucial to get it right as this is what determines if they will engage in the email.

Therefore it is directly tied to your open rate and the overall success of your email outreach.

### What makes a bad subject line?

When your buyer looks at their inbox, they evaluate every email through a mental spam filter.

They scan their emails to assess which they want to open, which they need to open, and which they can delete.

They rely on the sender's name, subject lines, and preview text.

If your prospect sees your subject line and thinks, "sales pitch," you're doing something wrong.

**Avoid the mental spam filter by not using the following:**

**Length 🥱** - Keep it short. Going from a two-word subject line to a four-word subject line reduces replies by 17.5% according to Lavender's data.

**Questions❓** - The subject line is not the place for questions. They can lower your open rate by 56% according to Lavender's data.

**Numbers 🔢** - Including numbers in your subject line reduces your chance of an open by 46.33% according to Lavender's data.

**Punctuation ⁉️** - Especially a "?" or a "!" Using punctuation reduces the likelihood of an open by 36% according to Lavender's data.

**Commands 💬** - E.g., "improve," "respond," "reply"

**Superlatives 💹** - E.g., "better," "improved," "accelerated"

**Clichés 👀** - E.g., "15 minutes?" "Thoughts?" "Quick Question"

**First names 👤** - Your reader knows their name. Research from Salesloft shows subject lines with first names receive 12% fewer replies. Plus this has been massively overused over the past few years.

### Examples of subject lines NOT to use 🙅‍♂️

❌ Struggling to get qualified leads John?

❌ 10x your revenue

❌ I will get you 100 leads for free!

❌ Sam, anytime for a call?

❌ Accelerate your reps ramp time

❌ Wish you could prospect faster?

### So what makes a great subject line?

Think about the emails you send and receive internally.

They're typically short, simple, and boring.

This is exactly what works best for your sales emails.

It works because these are quick to read, get to the point and set the correct expectations for what's inside the email.

When we say boring, we're talking about using a neutral tone.

Salesloft recently researched subject line sentiment and found that neutral tones received the most replies.

This is because neutral = short + descriptive.

When writing a neutral subject line, think: emotionless.

This is why we wouldn't want to use emojis or superlatives in it.

Instead, use factual and objective words.

Such as "RFP Response," "Reply Rates," or "Email Ramp."

**Tips for great subject lines:**

- **Describe what the email is about.** (e.g., "Personalization Issues")
- **Use title case.** (capitalizing the first letter of each word) Not using title case can reduce your opens by 30% according to Lavender's data.
- **Keep it short.** One to three is best. Two is optimal. Going from a two-word subject line to a four-word subject line reduces replies by 17.5%
- **Remember:** Make it sound like an internal email. What would you write if this email were going to a colleague? It's typically something short and descriptive.

### Great email subject line examples

✅ Ramp Time

✅ Email Writing

✅ Response Rates

✅ FX Rates

✅ Data Thoughts

### Don't Forget About Preview Text

The preview text is the line of copy that follows the subject line in your email.

The preview text is the real reason your email gets opened.

A subject line following the above advice passes the mental spam filter.

Now your preview text provides additional context to convince your reader to get it opened.

Most email will display the first few sentences from your email body as the preview text.

So by keeping subject lines short, you maximize the preview text shown.

This means the first two sentences in your email body are critical.

If it looks like an automated message, buyers will opt out.

If it showcases that the email is actually written for them and could be relevant, they'll dig in.

The preview should show the reader the message is written for them and, ideally, will be relevant to them.

This space is limited, so avoid clichés.

Instead, pique their interest and show value immediately.

**Key Takeaways:**
- Keep it at 2-3 words maximum
- Make it seem like an internal email
- Open rate is 90% of your subject line
- Don't make it feel "salesy" use a natural tone
- Make it super simple to understand what the email will be about

## Email CTAs (Calls to Action)

### The Basics

A CTA stands for a call to action, it just acts as a prompt that encourages the recipient to do something specific.

CTAs can make or break your email.

You can be as personalized & relevant as you want in the body of the email, but attaching the wrong CTA can destroy all that.

### What defines a good cold email CTA?

Most CTAs are focused on driving some kind of conversion like directly booking a meeting.

Instead, you really need to be focused on starting a conversation.

**Sales is a one-to-one conversation.**

### What shouldn't we do in our CTAs?

**😠 Direct CTAs**

These are the hardest in terms of tone.

Your value offering in a direct CTA is your time.

You are a stranger to the prospect, so unless you are a celebrity or their favorite cousin, your time is worth nothing.

So as your time has no value, the whole email value offering suffers because of this.

This CAN work but only in rare scenarios like when you are a market leader or you have a monopoly in the industry, but then meetings should be easy regardless.

### What we should do in our CTAs

**🤔 Interest-based CTAs**

These are the softest and have a major focus on curiosity & timing. It has a clear focus on starting the conversation rather than a hard ask.

Make it a super low friction ask, stuff like:
- Is it worth exploring X?
- How is the team doing Y?
- Is Z a focus for the team?

We can take this a step further with unsure tones.

A way to increase reply rates is to muddy your ask. Here's an example:

*"Worth a chat about how we can improve your reply rates?"*

You muddy the ask by sneaking in a benefit statement. Let the uncertainty shine. You diminish the ask by mixing in informative tones.

Say *"Worth a chat?"* instead.

Some other examples:
- Worth a peek?
- Open to hearing more?
- Open to learning how?

**💲 Value-based CTAs**

This is one of the BEST ways to get responses from prospects.

This strategy is based on offering something so valuable, it is a bad decision for your prospect to not reply to it.

If you had an offer for email coaching, an example could be:

"We made a sequence that's been getting 10+ meetings a month - mind if I share?"

The offering has to be related to your ICP, but the whole point is to give without asking for anything in return.

Don't talk about yourself instead.

## The T.I.P.S Email Framework

### Framework Overview

**T** - Trigger

**I** - Implication

**P** - Problem

**S** - Social Proof/Solution

### Trigger

Have a relevant trigger that explains why you are reaching out.

This can be a variety of things: a new job change, their teams expanded, they are actively hiring for roles etc.

Make it clear in the first line why it makes sense for them to talk with you.

### Implication

Imply what you think is a priority based on the trigger.

For example if they have just hired 5 new reps then focusing on ramping them would likely be a priority.

This is what will show it's not some generic spray & pray.

### Problem

Identify a common pain point usually faced by your ICP relating to the implication.

Dig into the pain, and why it should be a priority for them to fix.

People love to stay the same so show them the negative outcome of not changing.

Use the BAB Framework (Before After Bridge).

### Social Proof

Using social proof builds your credibility in your outreach.

If you have names to drop, do it!

Then add a desired outcome they achieved from working with you.

### Solution

Explain how your solution got the desired outcome from the social proof.

Keep it brief the goal is to get a response, not sell them on the email.

So don't start going into depth about exactly what you do, that's what a call is for after they respond.

### Soft CTA

Soft CTA to finish, the goal is to get a reply.

So stuff like "Worth a chat?" "Open to hearing more?" instead of asking for 30 minutes.

Bonus points if you use a lead magnet with a soft CTA.

---

## T.I.P.S Email Structure & Example

### Structure

Hey [name]

Looks like [relevant trigger], Imagine you're / thought you'd [implication based on trigger]

Usually, our customers struggle [main problem related to ICP]

So [dig into the pain]

We've been helping [social proof]

[positive outcome & how your solution did that]

[Soft CTA]

### Example

**Subj: Ramp Time**

> Hey Sam
> 
> Looks like you're hiring AE's in DC, imagine ramping them quickly is a priority.
> 
> Most sales leaders struggle to get reps ramped under 5 months.
> 
> The delays caused 65% of sales teams to miss quota in 2023.
> 
> We helped Gong's reps ramp <3 months with our coaching.
> 
> Open to seeing how?

Always use BAB when talking about pains.

Imagine you are showing the **before**

Then the **after**

Then **bridge** (how you helped them get there)

So you show:
- Where they are now
- The desired outcome they should want
- How you helped someone get there is the bridge

**Why this works:** The first part of the email explains why you're reaching out. Making an informed conclusion from observation shows you understand the situation they may be in. This builds credibility.

The second half backs up your ability to speak to that challenge. You have helped others, and sharing this gives the reader a concrete understanding of what you're bringing to the table.

## T.I.P.S Lead Magnet Email

### Why add a lead magnet?

Now we have a framework to craft relevant emails, let's make it even better.

As we said a lead magnet can massively help reply rates as you are giving without an ask.

### Structure

- Trigger
- Implication
- Problem
- Social proof
- Solution
- Lead magnet

### Example Email 1

> Hi Sam
> 
> Looks like you are managing the outbound team at Apple, imagine reps messaging is top of mind.
> 
> Typically companies have a great solution but struggle to convey it to their ICP.
> 
> Meaning they get on average 1% positive reply rates.
> 
> We helped Gong achieve a 5% positive reply rate with our coaching.
> 
> We made a list of the emails that got the most replies - mind if I share?
> 
> Thanks

![Email Coach interface showing email scoring at 97 with quality metrics for outreach email about messaging](IMAGE: Email Coach Analysis - Shows an email scoring tool rating an outreach email at 97 "READY" with analysis of long sentences, I:YOU ratio, formality, question count, and other metrics)

### Example Email 2

> Hey Sam
> 
> Noticed you're hiring 3 new SDR's curious if their outbound messaging is a focus.
> 
> Cold emails typically get a 30% open rate & a 3% reply rate.
> 
> Gong hit 60% open rates & 15% reply rates with this template we made - can I share them?

![Email Coach interface showing another email example with hiring SDRs trigger](IMAGE: Email Coach Analysis 2 - Shows email scoring for an SDR hiring-focused outreach email)

**Why they work:** This is concise & relevant copy. You have called out the reason for reaching out. You broke down what is likely their priority, the issue faced with that. Then gone into how you have helped a similar business achieve a desired result. THEN to top it off a PURE value-based CTA offering a resource that will help.

## Bump Email Strategy

### What is a follow-up email?

A bump email is a message you send to someone you've previously been in contact with.

A "bump" email can also be referred to as a follow-up email, they are the same thing.

### Why are they important?

People may miss your initial email.

They may be busy.

It may be lost in the 20 other emails they get.

So following up is essential to actually being seen.

On average it can take 3-4 touches to get a reply.

The fortune is in the follow-up.

But there's a right & a wrong way to go about it.

---

## What Makes a Bad Bump Email?

### Apologizing

"Sorry for the persistence...."

"Sorry to reach out again...."

This still blows my mind every time I see it.

You immediately come off as the creepy nagging ex-partner with this type of messaging.

It's also a huge waste of your preview line as this is what they'll see and what do you think will come across their mind?

Ugh not another sales person.

You instantly hit their mental spam filter.

So please, never do this.

### The lazy one-liner

"Any feedback"

"thoughts"

Seriously what is this.

The point of a follow-up email is to add relevancy so they know what your main initial email is about.

So how on earth does this help with that?!

It puts a ton of friction on the seller, as now they have to go and read and give you a detailed reply.

Overall it is a big no no.

Instead, use the thoughtful bump basic in the next section.

### Repetitive Bump

"Just wanted to check in"

"Just reminding you about my last email, look forward to your response"

You "reminding" them adds no value to their day.

If you do this you will land in their mental spam folder.

You just come across too salesy and desperate for a response.

### Overly Aggressive Bump

"What's the holdup?"

"This is a great opportunity you don't want to miss. Get back to me ASAP."

I mean do I even need to say more...

Nobody wants orders barked at them from strangers.

It comes across WAY too assertive.

Stay away from these, unless you want people to reply with some not-so-nice things to say.

---

## Bump Email Frameworks

### The 3rd Party Resource Bump 1

**Structure:**
- Bring up the name of the resource
- Reuse the insight from before
- Explain what it is & the value
- Nod back to original CTA

**Example:**

> Hey James, do you read Outreach's blog?
> 
> Assuming you're ramping those new reps, I thought you'd find it interesting.
> 
> The VP of Sales Dev at Segment wrote about how she scaled her team to a $3.2B acquisition.
> 
> They did it without using canned templates.
> 
> Any thoughts on my last note?

**Why this works:** Your reader knows you're trying to sell something. Most people send their own branded content. However, your company's content tends to be biased — at least, that's your buyer's perception.

By sending them a third-party resource, you're breaking a pattern. You're building trust on common, neutral ground. This approach creates a sense of safety. And by framing it to what you think they care about, you'll engage your reader.

---

### The 3rd Party Resource Bump 2

**Structure:**
- Key fact & figure from the article
- Link back to the original insight
- Pain / observation link
- Mind if I share how to avoid it

**Example:**

> George over 64% of new reps fail to ramp successfully.
> 
> I came across this article by Apollo.
> 
> Given ramping your reps is a priority, thought you'd find it interesting.
> 
> This trend is only looking to get worse in 2024.
> 
> Mind if I share 2-3 tips on how to avoid it?

![Email Coach showing 3rd party resource bump email with 99 score](IMAGE: Third Party Resource Email - Shows email coach scoring a 3rd party resource bump email at 99 with analysis metrics)

---

### Thoughtful Bump - Basic

**Structure:**
- NEVER just say thoughts
- Add context + bump

**Example:**

> Hey George
> 
> Given that you're growing the sales team, I thought this would be worth discussing.
> 
> Did you have any feedback on my note?

![Email Coach showing thoughtful bump email with 94 score](IMAGE: Thoughtful Bump Email - Shows email coach scoring a basic thoughtful bump at 94 with optimism tone detected)

**Why it works:** With this framework, you're doing two things:
- You're tapping into your reader's sense of urgency. No one wants to miss an important email.
- You're verifying that your message deserves urgency because you reference that context for why you reached out in this note and the original note you customized.

---

### Thoughtful Bump - Case Study

**Structure:**
- Context + bump
- Case study with link

**Example:**

> Hey John
> 
> Given ramp speed was a priority for you, thought this would be worth discussing.
> 
> Here's a quick breakdown on how we helped Gong half their ramp time.
> 
> Worth a chat?
> 
> [Link to case study]
> 
> Aaron

![Email Coach showing case study bump email with 97 score](IMAGE: Case Study Bump Email - Shows email coach scoring a case study bump email at 97)

---

### Thoughtful Bump - Clarify

**Structure:**
- Context + bump
- Clarify

**Example:**

> Hey George
> 
> Given ramp speed was a priority for you, thought this would be top of mind.
> 
> To clarify, we've built an online learning platform for your reps. It can be completed & reviewed at their own pace.
> 
> Reps ramp faster and you know they can get consistent results as they have the systems in place.
> 
> Think this could help your team?

![Email Coach showing clarify bump email with 98 score](IMAGE: Clarify Bump Email - Shows email coach scoring a clarifying bump email at 98 with happy/friendly tone)

---

### The Focus Bump

**Structure:**
- Trigger
- Focus
- CTA

**Example:**

> Hey Emmett
> 
> You've recently opened an office in Poland.
> 
> Usually that means there's a focus on scaling the client base outside the US.
> 
> Is that the case for you?

---

### The Referral Bump

**Example Structure:**

> Hey {{ first name}}
> 
> Assuming this doesn't fall under your scope, would it make more sense to talk to someone else?
> 
> Saw they {{relevant observation}}

---

### The Problem Bump

**Structure:**
- Have a relevant pain
- Build curiosity on how you can help it

**Example:**

> Hey John
> 
> Other VP of Sales are facing two problems when it comes to email outreach.
> 
> 1. Their reps don't put time into personalizing their messages, so reply rates lag
> 2. They do personalize but spend 10 minutes per email so the volume is lackluster
> 
> We're helping other businesses in the IT industry send personalized emails at scale with Clay.
> 
> Want to see how?

---

### The One Sentence Bump

**Structure:**
- One sentence referencing if the issue is still a priority

**Example Structures:**
- Is XYZ still a priority?
- Is [challenge] still a priority?
- Are you still working on <initiative to achieve outcome>?
- Last we spoke [X problem] was a focus. Is that still top of mind?

---

### The Lead Magnet Bump

**ONLY USE THIS IF YOU SENT A LEAD MAGNET AS THE INITIAL EMAIL!!**

**Structure:**
- Give the magnet away anyways
- How you link to the magnet

**Example:**

> Here's the template getting us 25+ replies anyway John.
> 
> Founders use our consulting to improve their GTM strategies, so that's how it ties in.
> 
> Either way, hope it's useful!

---

## Multi-Channel Sequence Strategy

### What is a multichannel sequence?

A multichannel sequence is a sequence across a range of different platforms.

For us this will typically be calls, emails and LinkedIn messages.

### Why use a multichannel sequence?

Not everyone picks up the phone to strangers, some will never.

Some never check their inbox.

Others aren't active on LinkedIn.

So spreading yourself across channels allows you to meet the prospects on their preferred platform.

This is key to increasing replies as a whole.

Not everyone buys the same.

### The Top Tips

- 97% of people are not in the market to buy now, so you need to reach out to enough people
- You will be forgotten, it is fine to re-sequence people after 30 days with a different reason to reach out to them
- All the touchpoints should interlink to the same key focus
- 15+ multi-channel steps - the more you are reaching out the better (so long as it has value)
- Focus on starting a conversation not booking the meeting right away
- Use multi-touchpoint days, it gives them the chance to respond on their preferred channel, for these days use time blocking to get all the tasks done well
- Never leave tasks unfinished, it piles up and can be overwhelming

---

## Multi-Channel Sequence Breakdown

### Email Buckets

1. **Initial Emails** - These follow the value email breakdown & T.I.P.S structure
2. **Value Adds** - This is giving something to help out the prospect
3. **Bump Emails** - These give context as to why you are reaching out
4. **Final Email** - The last email in the sequence to ask for referral

### Other Channels

1. **LinkedIn** - These are all the touches through LinkedIn
2. **Calls** - These are the steps to make cold calls

---

## The OOS (Outbound OS) Sequence

### Why this works so well?

- Mix of automated and manual steps, relevant + personalized
- Multiple touch points throughout the sequence, reaching out to stand out
- Multi touch-point days, increases your visibility

### Sequence Timeline

**Day 1:** Email 1 - T.I.P.S Framework, LinkedIn connection, Call

**Day 3:** Email 2 - 3rd Party Resource, LinkedIn Message, Call

**Day 5:** Email 3 - Thoughtful bump

**Day 6:** Call

**Day 7:** LinkedIn Message

**Day 8:** Call

**Day 12:** Email 4 NT - T.I.P.S Framework, Call

**Day 15:** Email 5 - Case study, Call

**Day 18:** Email 6 - Focus Bump

**Day 19:** Call

**Day 21:** Email 7 - Referral
